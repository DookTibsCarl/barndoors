overlapping "hidden" portion of a masked item interferes with underlying text
firefox requires the svg crop elements to be pre-defined in the html -- adding them on-the-fly fails

next steps:
	swapping in different versions based on size/ability of browser
	adding some basic controls (next/prev, pause, etc.)
  improve namespacing/destination of compiled js, inheritance hierarchy for views (simplify the base abstract, relocate the util code, etc.), figure out jquery load errors, etc.
