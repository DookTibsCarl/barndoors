for IE: add a second text title area that can be completely blurred, hide it from screen readers, only do this for IE8&9 and below
figure out max size for collapsed/fullbelow views and size the desc field dynamically
make the up/down tray&arrow fixed height (23px for the tray, ??? for the arrow)




These were old tests before i branched - as of 2014-07-09 this worked on all these browsers. Only caveat is 
IE8 doesn't have diagonal slice.
